# Excalibot 2026 Source Code

This is team 27966's source code, this has been publised to teach teammates the inner working of the robot, it is planned to get documented.

It may look **overwhelming** but all the actual code build my me is in [teamcode](https://github.com/UltraFish19/Excalibot27966-26/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode), however you do need android studio.
